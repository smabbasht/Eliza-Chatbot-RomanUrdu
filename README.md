## What is eliza chatbot:
Eliza was an early example of a computer program that attempted to simulate human conversation through natural language processing. Developed in the mid-1960s at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum, Eliza used simple pattern matching techniques to respond to user input in a way that mimicked a psychotherapist. While Eliza's conversational abilities were limited, it was a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and inspired the development of later chatbot technologies.
